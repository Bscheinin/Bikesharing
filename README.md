Bike sharing project with Tableau
# Surfs_Up_Analysis

## Project Overview
In the spirit of freedom that one feels when getting on a bicycle, 
We are looking to bring that feeling to the people of Des Moines, IA. Ridesharing, and specifically, Bikesharing provide a means of transportation for commuting and leisure. This project analyzed the bikesharing market in New York City to determine the feasibility of starting a bikesharing venture in Des Moines, IA. 

 
## Project Resources
Tableau was used to analyze, visualize, and present the data which Python was used to clean the original data source.


## Analysis Results
The results of the data analysis of the NYC data was captured in several ways.

## Summary
This narrow analysis shows us that temperatures have very little change from the summer to winter seasons on the island of Oahu. However, there is more information needed to make an important investment decision. As a partner, I would want to know the average percipitation between these two months as well as which reporting station provided the weather conditions most condusive to surfing. This could show us that location of our new surf shop should be on the east side of the island versus the west. I would need more information than just summary temperature statistics to make an informed decision about this investment.
